Read the data.frame using read.csv()
``` {r} 
raw.data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## Use dplyr package for efficient filtering and display
library(dplyr)
library(plyr)
data <- tbl_df(raw.data)

## Calculate the total number of steps taken per day. draw a cross-tabulation. 
xtabs(steps ~ date, data=data)


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
